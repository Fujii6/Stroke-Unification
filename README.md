Aimed to create a unified, national stroke center databaseâ€”one of the few existing efforts to do so.
Stroke certification varies by state, requiring data collection from three major certification organizations. Due to discrepancies in data storage, availability, and organization, unifying these datasets was a complex process that took months to complete. Data was manually collected and geocoded in R, ensuring de-duplication and accuracy. The final dataset, created through the multi-code project, is one of the most comprehensive and accurate stroke databases available in the U.S.
The primary goal of this project was to develop an automated system for integrating and maintaining a national stroke certification database. However, the complexities of state-level certification standards made full automation infeasible. Each state has distinct criteria for stroke center designation, with some requiring certification from national accrediting organizations, others mandating direct state approval, and some utilizing a hybrid approach. These differences necessitated extensive manual validation and reconciliation, making the process far more labor-intensive than initially anticipated.
While replication of this process was a priority, future efforts may face challenges due to the intensive work and complexities involved in data integration. Nevertheless, this work has laid a strong foundation for further refinement, potentially informing policy discussions and guiding future standardization efforts in stroke certification at a national level.
